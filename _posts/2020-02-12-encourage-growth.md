With every day that passes, something within the Information Technology (IT) field has changed rendering an old way of doing something obsolete or no longer relevant. In order to remain an effective IT professional, you are expected to stay up on the latest evolutionary trends within this field or you will fall behind.

At times this is very intimidating and is often too time consuming to keep on track with a regular cadence. Mindsets on professional development are also viewed at different perspectives ranging from necessity, priority or whether or not it's part of your role.

***Overtime this will branch staff into three categories of performance:***

## High Performer

High performing staff are the ones that go above and beyond the call of duty on a daily basis and your go to when you just want something done sooner than later or done correctly. They are generally seen as your subject matter experts are more technically proficient and tend to have more work thrown their way. They are also the first ones to become burned out.

## Average Performer

Average performing staff are the ones that can get their own job done, but when you introduce something new or they go out of their comfort zone they will rely on high performers to help them out. They generally don’t have the confidence to move out of their comfort zone.

## Low Performer

Low performing staff are the ones that are seen as doing the bare minimum to get by and are usually the ones will be the first avoid difficult or new situations and are often unwilling to develop new skill sets. These staff exist due to a lack of accountability on themselves and a lack of professional development as a whole.

***This exists everywhere and is expected in large organizations so what is the point?***

Allowing these labels to become the status quo of your team dynamics is only going to hurt your team and your organization. This will encourage bad behaviors such as free riding, lack of collaboration, information being kept in a silo and eventually burnout.

If you're relying too much on high performing staff, what happens when they leave with all their knowledge? Do you want the gears in your engine to be all metal, or would you settle for 25% metal and 75% plastic? We need to find ways to `encourage` `continual` `growth` through a positive approach vs waiting for something to break.

***Introducing positive incentives encourage professional development and transforms staff into high performers***

We need to introduce a strategy where staff are given a *positive incentive* to pursue professional growth. Whether it’s a bump in compensation, recognition, appreciation letters being hand written and mailed home, growth opportunities within the organization or even more responsibilities if that is their goal. *Take the time to talk to your team and ask them what would drive them to grow.*

## This type of effort has a multiple and long lasting effects:

* High performing staff will start to feel more appreciated for the amount of work they put in for their own professional development. When you're a high performer, whether you're a natural leader or you continually build yourself up, the pressure that comes with the demand to maintain this level of effort becomes less stressful and you will find this will lead to more positive results.

* Low / Average performing staff, will also start to see the benefits of professional development; knowing that if they take the time to learn something new they will benefit, in turn the organization will benefit as they'll become a more valuable resource and you'll retain staff.

## Encouraging growth is the path to transforming staff

You're going to see team dynamics change drastically as more and more staff will start seeing their own return on investments. High performers will feel less pressure. Average performers will gain the confidence to move outside their comfort zone and low performers will start to transform themselves and will move up the performance ladder. Everyone will become a solid metal gear.

Through persistence you gain knowledge, through knowledge you earn opportunity and through opportunity you can change the course of your future. Self-improvement has a ripple affect where not only you benefit but those around you will as well. 

Plant the seed and you will encourage growth.
