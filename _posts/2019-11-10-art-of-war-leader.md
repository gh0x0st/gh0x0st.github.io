>Being a cyber security leader is something that is learned through the failures and successes from others and yourself but comes down to your ability to be able to strategize and your ability to work with and understand people.

You can learn all this through experience, but you can take a step ahead of the curve by absorbing the lessons from "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu and correlating them to cyber security. Sun Tzu stressed the importance of intelligence operatives to the war effort, in our case here, I'll share four quotes from this literature that I feel are important to help manifest yourself into a successful leader.

## “Victory comes from finding opportunities in problems.”

Whether you're on a red or blue team, `you're an advisor to risk`. When you're advising your stakeholders on an identified risk, look for ways to not only eliminate the risk, but find ways to take the opportunity to empower those who will be impacted by the change.

Let's say you're new on a blue team and you're running a scan against your systems and find out that a lot of servers aren't patched properly and are all vulnerable to MS17-010. This is an opportunity to show support staff how to identify whether SMB is needed on a system, or perhaps how they can implement a patching strategy on the impacted devices.

On the red side of things, you're in the middle of an engagement and you find that there are open shares that are hosting sensitive information or perhaps are set with improper NTFS permissions. You can take this as an opportunity to promote awareness on how to create shares with proper ACLs and how they can find open shares proactively.

If you provide your team fish, they'll eat, but teach them to fish and they'll eat for a lifetime. Knowledge influences opportunity and in our case here, spreading security knowledge will provide opportunities to implement more secure systems.

## “If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.”

You need to know and accept your own limitations, this is a very hard thing to do regardless of your field of expertise. Let's break this down a little bit:

**Know the enemy:** In our case, the enemy will be hackers, misconfigurations and end users (such as falling for a phishing email). Look at your environment and understand how it could be compromised or how something could be put at risk through the actions of another.

**Know yourself:** Accept where you are weak and either seek to improve yourself or ask for help. We all know that cyber security threats are evolving every single day and we are under constant pressure to stay ahead of that curve. If you are tasked with protecting something that is not your forte, take a class on it, look up YouTube videos, online articles, or be straight up honest and accept that you need guidance or help. If you over commit yourself where you're not comfortable, it will only hurt you and what you're trying to protect.

If you know how hackers will attack something and you realize whether you know how to defend against it, you will be more a more effective leader by knowing what route to go.

## "The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.” 

There's no doubt that we want to eliminate risk as fast as we can, but too much change can have unfortunate outcomes, especially in a large environment. You need to keep the business and other workflows in mind when you are planning out a new initiative keep it strategic. No matter how basic the security concept, keep in mind all potential impacts. For example:

### Removing local admins from non-essential staff?

* Test all applications to ensure they work properly without admin privileges
* Train support staff on how to troubleshoot issues with applications that no longer run properly, such as identifying NTFS permissions, finding run as admin flags in compatibility settings and in the registry, using process monitor, etc.
* Who will be allowed to be admins?
* Who gets access to the admin passwords?
* What happens when someone with knowledge of admin passwords leaves or moves into a different role?
* Will these accounts be local or domain accounts?

This just a rough intro in the security concept, but just keep in mind, even a simple security principle needs to be thoroughly planned out. You can harden a potential attack vector, but if you do not plan properly, you could cripple your team.

## “Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons. And they will follow you into the deepest valley.”

This is a concept that you will learn in time but is easier said than done; we need to keep our egos in check. If you're working within a division, no doubt you're going to have to different specialties and experiences amongst the IT staff.

As much as we would love for every single person to have the mind of a cyber security professional, that is not going to be the case. You're the one in a cyber security role, it's your place to promote awareness and advise risk. You don't like how a web server was built because it exposes sensitive directories? Perhaps that web developer has never been made aware that a specific configuration option was dangerous because they don't see the risk the same way you do. There's no parameter sanitation on a home-grown app? Perhaps no one provided guidance on secure coding practices.

You need to be willing to teach and share knowledge. Not everyone is going to have specialized cyber security training or the same fancy certifications that you do. If someone does something that you don't approve of, don't go kicking down the doors and make them out to feel little. You will always attract more bees with honey.

The more you're willing to work with people, the more likely they will be to be responsive to a new initiative, or even better, the less likely they'll be to hide something from you for fear of being belittled.

## Wrapping it all up

Remember that as much as you're working with technology, you're also working with people. Every change you make will affect your peers one way or another even if you're only targeting an information system. Slow down, reflect before you react and reach out for input.

Getting approval from senior leadership is important but don't forget your peers. Make them feel safe about the conversation you want to have with them. Help them feel appreciated about the initiative you're trying to push and if you can get past these two barriers, then you'll draw them into your goal. These are traits of an effective leader.
