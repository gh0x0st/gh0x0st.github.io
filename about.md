My primary focus is to develop strategies and implement controls to defend Hospitals from adversaries as well as validating controls through offensive security. However, like many of you, I have a common goal, which is to become the strongest version of myself as both a leader and professional. 

I strongly believe that knowledge sharing is the most important aspect of any information security program and should be treated as a `skillset` as much as a `mindset`. It's not just sharing knowledge of threats but also the sharing of effective workflows and strategies.

> You want to know the difference between a master and a beginner? The master has failed more times than the beginner has ever tried. 

To that effect, my goal is to impart my knowledge from my own lessons learned, to help pave the way into someone else's journey into a red or blue team professional.
